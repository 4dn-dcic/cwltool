Issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in cwltool (reference implementation) itself.
Please use the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) or [Biostars forum](https://www.biostars.org/) 
for general questions about using cwltool to create/run workflows or issues not related to cwltool.

If you'd like to report a bug, fill out the template below and provide
any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, you create an [MCVE](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) reproducing
the problem before opening an issue to ensure it's not caused by something in
your code.
