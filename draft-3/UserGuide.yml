      ## First example

      The simplest "hello world" program.  This accepts one input parameter,
      writes a message to the terminal or job log, and produces no permanent
      output.  CWL documents are written in [JSON](http://json.org) or
      [YAML](http://yaml.org), or a mix of the two.

      *example-1st.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-1st.cwl
    - |
      ```

      Use a JSON object in a separate file to describe the input of a run:

      *example-echo-job.json*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-echo-job.json
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner example-echo.cwl example-echo-job.json
      [job 140199012414352] $ echo 'Hello world!'
      Hello world!
      Final process status is success
      ```

      What's going on here?  Let's break it down:

      ```
      class: CommandLineTool
      ```

      The `class` field indicates this document describes a command line tool.

      ```
      baseCommand: echo
      ```

      The `baseCommand` provides the name of program that will actually run
      (echo)

      ```
      inputs:
        - id: message
          type: string
          inputBinding:
            position: 1
      ```

      The `inputs` section describes the inputs of the tool.  This is a list of input
      parameters and each parameter includes an identifier, a data type, and
      optionally an `inputBinding` which describes how this input parameter
      should appear on the command line.  In this example, the `position` field
      indicates where it should appear on the command line.

      ```
      outputs: []
      ```

      This tool has no formal output, so the `outputs` section is an empty list.

      ## Essential input parameters

      The `inputs` of a tool is a list of input parameters that control how to
      run the tool.  Each parameter has an `id` for the name of parameter, and
      `type` describing what types of values are valid for that parameter.

      Available primitive types are *string*, *int*, *long*, *float*, *double*,
      and *null*; complex types are *array* and *record*; in addition there are
      special types *File* and *Any*.

      The following example demonstrates some input parameters with different
      types and appearing on the command line in different ways:


      *example-inp.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-inp.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *example-inp-job.json*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-inp-job.json
    - |
      ```

      Invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner example-inp.cwl example-inp-job.json
      [job 140020149614160] /home/example$ echo -f -i42 --example-string hello --file=/home/example/whale.txt
      -f -i42 --example-string hello --file=/home/example/whale.txt
      Final process status is success
      ```

      The field `inputBinding` is optional and indicates whether and how the
      input parameter should be appear on the tool's command line.  If
      `inputBinding` is missing, the parameter does not appear on the command
      line.  Let's look at each example in detail.

      ```
      - id: example_flag
        type: boolean
        inputBinding:
          position: 1
          prefix: -f
      ```

      Boolean types are treated as a flag.  If the input parameter
      "example_flag" is "true", then `prefix` will be added to the
      command line.  If false, no flag is added.

      ```
      - id: example_string
        type: string
        inputBinding:
          position: 3
          prefix: --example-string
      ```

      String types appear on the command line as literal values.  The `prefix`
      is optional, if provided, it appears as a separate argument on the
      command line before the parameter .  In the example above, this is
      rendered as `--example-string hello`.

      ```
      - id: example_int
        type: int
        inputBinding:
          position: 2
          prefix: -i
          separate: false
      ```

      Integer (and floating point) types appear on the command line with
      decimal text representation.  When the option `separate` is false (the
      default value is true), the prefix and value are combined into a single
      argument.  In the example above, this is rendered as `-i42`.


      ```
      - id: example_file
        type: ["null", File]
        inputBinding:
          prefix: --file=
          separate: false
          position: 4
      ```

      File types appear on the command line as the path to the file.  When the
      parameter type is a list, this indicates several alternate types are
      valid for this parameter.  The most common use is to provide "null" as an
      alternate parameter type, which indicates that the parameter is optional.
      In the example above, this is rendered as `--file=/home/example/whale.txt`.

      The value of `position` is used to determine where parameter should
      appear on the command line.  Positions are relative to one another, not
      abosolute.  As a result, positions do not have to be sequential, three
      parameters with positions `[1, 3, 5]` will result in the same command
      line as `[1, 2, 3]`.  More than one parameter can have the same position
      (ties are broken using the parameter name), and the position field itself
      is optional.  the default position is 0.

      The `baseCommand` field always comes before parameters.

      ## Returning output files

      The `outputs` of a tool is a list of output parameters that should be
      returned after running the tool.  Each parameter has an `id` for the name
      of parameter, and `type` describing what types of values are valid for
      that parameter.

      When a tool runs under CWL, the starting working directory is the
      designated output directory.  The underlying tool or script must record
      its results in the form of files created in the output directory.  The
      output parameters returned by the CWL tool are either the output files
      themselves, or come from examining the content of those files.

      *example-tar.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-tar.cwl
    - |
      ```

      *example-tar-job.json*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-tar-job.json
    - |
      ```

      Invoke `cwl-runner` with the tool wrapper and the input object on the
      command line:
      ```
      $ cwl-runner example-tar.cwl example-tar-job.json
      [job 139868145165200] $ tar xvf /home/example/hello.tar
      hello.txt
      Final process status is success
      {
      "example_out": {
        "path": "hello.txt",
        "size": 13,
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$47a013e660d408619d894b20806b1d5086aab03b"
        }
      }
      ```

      The field `outputBinding` describes how to to set the value of each
      output parameter.

      ```
      outputs:
        - id: example_out
          type: File
          outputBinding:
            glob: hello.txt
      ```

      The `glob` field consists of the name of a file in the output directory.
      If you don't know name of the file in advance, you can use a wildcard
      pattern.

      ## Capturing a tool's standard output stream

      To capture a tool's standard output stream, add the `stdout` field with
      the name of the file where the output stream should go.  Then use `glob`
      on `outputBinding` to return the file.

      *example-stdout.cwl*
      ```
    - $include: draft-3/example-stdout.cwl
    - |
      ```

      Now invoke `cwl-runner` providing the tool wrapper and the input object
      on the command line:

      ```
      $ cwl-runner example-stdout.cwl example-echo-job.json
      [job 140199012414352] $ echo 'Hello world!' > output.txt
      Final process status is success
      {
      "output": {
        "path": "output.txt",
        "size": 13,
        "class": "File",
        "checksum": "sha1$47a013e660d408619d894b20806b1d5086aab03b"
        }
      }
      $ cat output.txt
      Hello world!
      ```
