# Common Workflow Language Specifications, draft-3

The CWL specifications are divided up into several documents.

The [Command Line Tool Description Specification](CommandLineTool.html)
specifies the schema and semantics for wrapping and executing command line
tools.

The [Workflow Description Specification](Workflow.html) specifies the schema
and semantics for composing workflows from components such as command line
tools and other workflows.

The
[Semantic Annotations for Linked Avro Data (SALAD) Specification](SchemaSalad.html)
specifies the preprocessing steps that must be applied when loading CWL
documents and the schema language used to write the above specifications.
